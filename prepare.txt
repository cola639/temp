I have made a Word document about useful plugins for IntelliJ IDEA and VSCode
I’ll quickly share my screen to show how to install them. 
I believe these plugins will be quite helpful for our development.
After the meeting, I’ll check with Chris on how to upload them to the group development folder

On the weekdays this week, I will spend my time learning the code and setting up the remaining environment configurations
